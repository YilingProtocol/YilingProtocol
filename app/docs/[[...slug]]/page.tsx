## What is Yiling Protocol?

Yiling Protocol is an **open, oracle-free truth discovery infrastructure** live on Base. It implements the SKC (Srinivasan-Karger-Chen) mechanism — a mathematically proven system where consensus emerges from game theory, not external oracles or human referees.

Based on [peer-reviewed research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04305) from Harvard (published at ACM EC 2025), the protocol provides a general-purpose primitive for **eliciting and aggregating truthful information** in any context where ground truth is unverifiable, subjective, or long-horizon.

## The Problem

Systems that need to determine truth — prediction markets, governance, dispute resolution — all face the same bottleneck: **who decides what's true?**

- **Prediction markets** depend on external oracles (Polymarket's UMA oracle was [manipulated in 2025](https://orochi.network/blog/oracle-manipulation-in-polymarket-2025))
- **DAO governance** relies on token-weighted voting (plutocracy, low participation)
- **Dispute resolution** requires trusted arbiters (centralization, bias)

Every system that relies on an external authority to determine truth inherits that authority's limitations, biases, and attack surface.

## The Solution

Yiling Protocol removes the oracle entirely. Instead, truth emerges from **game theory and information aggregation**:

- **Self-resolving** — markets close themselves through probabilistic stopping
- **Truthful equilibrium** — honest reporting is a Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium (mathematically proven)
- **Cross-entropy scoring** — participants earn rewards proportional to accuracy
- **Bond-based** — every report requires a deposit, creating real skin in the game
- **Permissionless** — anyone can create markets or connect agents
- **Live on Base** — deployed and running with low gas fees

## Applications

| Application | What It Replaces |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Prediction Markets | External oracles (UMA, Chainlink) |
| DAO Governance | Token-weighted voting |
| Dispute Resolution | Trusted arbiters, courts |
| Data Labeling & AI | Human review pipelines |
| Subjective Oracles | Oracle committees |`,

  "getting-started/how-it-works": `# How It Works

## The Flow

\`\`\`
1. Anyone creates a market ("question + parameters")
       ↓
2. Agents report sequentially (each posts a bond)
       ↓
3. After each report: random stop check (probability α)
       ↓
4. Market resolves → last report = reference truth
       ↓
5. Cross-entropy scoring calculates payouts
       ↓
6. Agents claim: bond + reward (accurate) or bond - penalty (inaccurate)
\`\`\`

## The Key Insight

Every agent could be the last one, and the last agent's report *becomes* truth. Since the last agent has observed all previous reports plus their own private information, they represent the most informed view. This makes honest reporting the dominant strategy for *every* agent at *every* step.

## Protocol Components

## Integration Patterns

**Pattern 1: Direct Contract Interaction** — Use any web3 library (ethers.js, viem, web3.py) to interact with deployed contracts on Base.

**Pattern 2: Build on Top** — Embed Yiling as a resolution primitive in your protocol. Your governance, dispute, or oracle system calls the contracts to resolve questions.

**Pattern 3: Connect Agents** — Build AI agents that participate in markets, using any LLM or algorithm.`,

  // ── USE CASES ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  "use-cases/prediction-markets": `# Prediction Markets

Build oracle-free prediction markets where truth emerges from game theory instead of external resolution.

## The Oracle Problem

Traditional prediction markets (Polymarket, Augur, Kalshi) depend on external oracles to determine outcomes. In March 2025, a UMA token holder [manipulated a Polymarket resolution](https://orochi.network/blog/oracle-manipulation-in-polymarket-2025) by controlling 25% of voting power — flipping a market from 9% to 100% despite no real-world event occurring.

For subjective or long-horizon questions — *"Will AI surpass human reasoning by 2030?"* — no reliable oracle even exists.

## How Yiling Solves This

The SKC mechanism uses probabilistic stopping and cross-entropy scoring so that **truth emerges from the participants themselves**, with no oracle needed.

\`\`\`
Create market → Agents submit predictions → Random stop check
→ Last prediction = reference truth → Cross-entropy payouts
\`\`\`

## Advantages Over Existing Solutions

| Feature | Polymarket/Augur | Yiling Protocol |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Resolution | External oracle | Self-resolving (SKC) |
| Oracle manipulation | Possible (UMA 2025) | Impossible — no oracle |
| Subjective questions | Limited | Native support |
| Deployment | Centralized | Permissionless on Base |
| Truthfulness | Not guaranteed | Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium |

## Best For

- Subjective or unverifiable questions
- Long-horizon forecasting (years, decades)
- Markets where oracle manipulation is a risk
- Permissionless, decentralized prediction platforms`,

  "use-cases/governance": `# DAO Governance

Replace token-weighted voting with game-theoretically optimal truth discovery.

## The Problem with Token Voting

Most DAOs use token-weighted voting: 1 token = 1 vote. This creates well-documented problems:

- **Plutocracy** — whales dominate decisions
- **Low participation** — voter apathy (often <5% turnout)
- **No skin in the game** — voting is free, so uninformed voting costs nothing
- **Binary choices** — up/down vote loses nuance

## How Yiling Solves This

Instead of voting on proposals, DAO members **report their honest belief** about whether a proposal will achieve its stated goal. The SKC mechanism ensures honesty is the dominant strategy because:

1. Every reporter posts a bond (skin in the game)
2. Cross-entropy scoring rewards accuracy, not majority position
3. Probabilistic stopping makes manipulation impossible

\`\`\`
Proposal: "Should we allocate 500K to marketing?"
        ↓
Reframed: "Will allocating 500K to marketing increase TVL by >20%?"
        ↓
Agents report probability → SKC resolves → consensus emerges
\`\`\`

## Advantages Over Token Voting

| Feature | Token Voting | Yiling Governance |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Sybil resistance | Requires token | Bond-based |
| Informed decisions | No incentive | Accuracy rewarded |
| Manipulation | Whale dominance | Game-theoretically secure |
| Nuance | Binary yes/no | Continuous probability |
| Participation | Free (apathy) | Bonded (skin in game) |

## Best For

- Subjective governance decisions ("Is this grant worth funding?")
- Parameter tuning ("Should we change the fee to 3%?")
- Treasury allocation decisions
- Protocol upgrade assessments`,

  "use-cases/dispute-resolution": `# Dispute Resolution

Resolve disputes without trusted arbiters, courts, or centralized panels.

## The Problem

Decentralized systems — marketplaces, insurance, escrow — need dispute resolution but face a dilemma: any human arbiter introduces centralization, bias, and cost. Existing solutions (Kleros, Aragon Court) use token-staked juries, which still suffer from whale manipulation and low-quality judgments.

## How Yiling Solves This

Frame any dispute as a question and let the SKC mechanism resolve it. Reporters bond tokens to submit their assessment. The mechanism's game-theoretic properties ensure honest reporting without needing a trusted judge.

\`\`\`
Dispute: "Did the contractor deliver the work as specified?"
        ↓
Market created → Assessors submit probability reports
        ↓
SKC resolves → Consensus probability = resolution
        ↓
If probability > threshold → resolved in favor of contractor
\`\`\`

## Use Cases

- **Marketplace disputes** — buyer/seller disagreements
- **Insurance claims** — "Did the insured event occur?"
- **Bounty verification** — "Was the bounty completed satisfactorily?"
- **Content takedown appeals** — "Does this content violate policy?"
- **Smart contract escrow** — automated release based on consensus

## Advantages

| Feature | Traditional Arbitration | Yiling Resolution |
|---------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Speed | Days to weeks | Minutes to hours |
| Cost | Expensive | Bond-based (recovered if honest) |
| Bias | Arbiter-dependent | Game-theoretically neutral |
| Scalability | Limited by humans | Unlimited on-chain |
| Transparency | Opaque | Fully on-chain |`,

  "use-cases/data-labeling": `# Data Labeling & AI

Incentivize truthful data labeling for AI training without centralized review pipelines.

## The Problem

AI training requires massive labeled datasets. Current approaches:

- **Human review** — expensive ($0.10–$2.00 per label), inconsistent, slow
- **Crowdsourcing** — quality varies wildly, gaming incentives
- **Expert panels** — doesn't scale, bottleneck
- **LLM self-labeling** — circular, amplifies biases

The core issue: **how do you verify label quality without a ground truth oracle?** This is exactly the problem the SKC mechanism was designed to solve.

## How Yiling Solves This

Each labeling task becomes a market. Labelers post bonds and submit their assessments. The SKC mechanism's cross-entropy scoring naturally rewards accurate labelers and penalizes inaccurate ones — without ever needing a "gold standard" ground truth.

\`\`\`
Task: "Is this image NSFW?" / "Is this text toxic?"
        ↓
Labelers submit probability assessments with bonds
        ↓
SKC resolves → consensus label + quality scores per labeler
        ↓
Use scores to weight labels and build reputation
\`\`\`

## Why This Works

The SKC mechanism is a form of **information elicitation without verification**. The key insight from the [Harvard research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04305):

> *"A reference agent with access to more information can serve as a reasonable proxy for the ground truth."*

Each subsequent labeler sees previous labels and adds their own signal. The final labeler's assessment — informed by all predecessors — becomes the reference truth.

## Applications

- **Content moderation** — toxic, NSFW, misinformation detection
- **RLHF data** — preference labels for AI alignment
- **Medical imaging** — diagnostic label consensus
- **Fact-checking** — claim verification
- **Sentiment analysis** — subjective classification at scale`,

  "use-cases/subjective-oracles": `# Subjective Oracles

Provide on-chain oracle services for questions that have no objective, verifiable answer.

## The Problem

Existing oracles (Chainlink, Pyth, UMA) work well for objective data: prices, sports scores, weather. But a large class of on-chain decisions depend on **subjective** information:

- *"Is this NFT derivative art or a copy?"*
- *"Did this protocol deliver on its roadmap?"*
- *"Is this community proposal beneficial?"*
- *"Has this real-world event meaningfully occurred?"*

No price feed or API can answer these questions. Traditional optimistic oracles (UMA) use token-staked voting, which is vulnerable to whale manipulation.

## How Yiling Solves This

Yiling Protocol acts as a **subjective oracle primitive**. Any smart contract can request a resolution by creating a market, and the SKC mechanism produces a consensus probability that other contracts can consume.

\`\`\`

## Comparison

| Feature | Chainlink | UMA | Yiling |
|---------|-----------|-----|--------|
| Objective data | Yes | Yes | No (use Chainlink) |
| Subjective data | No | Limited | Yes (native) |
| Oracle manipulation | N/A | Possible (2025) | Impossible |
| Resolution method | Data feeds | Token voting | SKC mechanism |
| Truthfulness guarantee | Data quality | Economic | Mathematical (PBE) |

## Best For

- **Subjective on-chain decisions** that no data feed can answer
- **Complementing existing oracles** — use Chainlink for prices, Yiling for everything else
- **Cross-protocol resolution** — multiple dApps can share Yiling as their subjective oracle`,

  // ── SKC MECHANISM ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  "mechanism/skc": `# SKC Mechanism

The SKC (Srinivasan-Karger-Chen) mechanism, from [peer-reviewed Harvard research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04305) published at ACM EC 2025.

## Core Innovation

The SKC mechanism solves the fundamental problem of **information elicitation without verification** — how to discover truth when ground truth cannot be directly observed. It does this by using a carefully chosen **reference agent** as a proxy for ground truth, with mathematical guarantees that honest reporting is optimal.

## How It Works

1. **Market created** with question + parameters
2. **Agents report sequentially** — each posts a bond, observes all previous reports
3. **Random stop** — after each report: \`hash % WAD < α?\`
4. **Resolution** — last report becomes reference truth (qFinal)
5. **Scoring** — cross-entropy delta determines payouts

## Why It Works

Every agent could be the last one. The last agent has observed **all previous reports** plus their own private information, making them the most informed participant. Their report naturally aggregates all distributed information in the system.

**Theorem (Srinivasan, Karger, Chen):** When the reference agent observes k independent informational substitutes, the strategic advantage of deviating from truthful reporting diminishes exponentially: |Δ| ≤ (1-δ)^k.

This constitutes a **Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium** — no agent benefits from lying, regardless of what other agents do.

## Payout Types

**Scored agents** (first n-k):
\`\`\`
payout = max(0, bond + b × [S(qFinal, priceAfter) - S(qFinal, priceBefore)])
\`\`\`

**Last k agents:**
\`\`\`
payout = bond + R
\`\`\`

The last k agents always profit, which incentivizes late participation even when consensus is mature.

## Handling Strategic Behavior

The mechanism addresses three potential manipulation vectors:

1. **Misleading the reference agent** — Solved by the reference agent having k independent informational substitutes that "wash out" any single agent's influence.

2. **Hedging toward the prior** — Solved by market termination structure ensuring most agents are observed.

3. **Uninformative equilibria** — Solved by flat rewards only for final k agents; earlier agents must differentiate to earn scoring rewards.

## Comparison to Related Approaches

| Framework | Needs Ground Truth | Elicits Beliefs | Aggregates Info | Single Task |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Traditional Markets | Yes (oracle) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Peer Prediction | No | Yes | No | Yes |
| Output Agreement | No | No | Yes | No |
| **SKC (Yiling)** | **No** | **Yes** | **Yes** | **Yes** |`,

  "mechanism/scoring": `# Cross-Entropy Scoring

## The Formula

\`\`\`
S(q, p) = q × ln(p) + (1-q) × ln(1-p)
\`\`\`

- q = final market price (reference truth)
- p = predicted probability

## Delta Payout

Each agent's payout is based on how much they moved the price toward truth:

\`\`\`
Δ = S(qFinal, priceAfter) - S(qFinal, priceBefore)
payout = max(0, bond + b × Δ)
\`\`\`

## Example: Accurate Prediction

\`\`\`
qFinal = 0.80, priceBefore = 0.50, priceAfter = 0.75

S(0.80, 0.75) = -0.507
S(0.80, 0.50) = -0.693
Δ = +0.186

bond=0.1, b=1: payout = 0.1 + 0.186 = 0.286 (+186% profit)
\`\`\`

## Example: Inaccurate Prediction

\`\`\`
qFinal = 0.80, priceBefore = 0.70, priceAfter = 0.40

Δ = -0.309
payout = max(0, 0.1 - 0.309) = 0 (bond lost)
\`\`\`

## Key Properties

- **Incentive compatible** — honesty maximizes expected payoff
- **Bold correct moves** earn more than small adjustments
- **Max loss** = bond amount (never more)
- All computed on-chain in FixedPointMath.sol`,

  "mechanism/research": `# Academic Research

**Self-Resolving Prediction Markets for Unverifiable Outcomes**

- [arXiv (v2, Feb 2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04305)

### Abstract

The paper addresses prediction markets for outcomes that cannot be directly verified. It proposes a mechanism that pays agents the **negative cross-entropy** between their prediction and that of a carefully chosen reference agent. Markets terminate probabilistically, and the final agent — who observes all prior forecasts — serves as a proxy for ground truth.

### Key Results

**Theorem 1 (Exponential Decay):** When the reference agent observes k independent informational substitutes, the strategic adjustment term diminishes exponentially: |Δ| ≤ (1-δ)^k.

**Theorem 2 (Strict Truthfulness):** If k exceeds a threshold depending on prior beliefs, signal granularity (τ), and information quality parameters (δ, η), then truthful reporting strictly dominates any deviation.

**Theorem 3 (ε-PBE):** Without knowledge of τ, the mechanism achieves ε-Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium where the maximum gain from deviation is bounded by 𝒟_η(Δ, **y**), decreasing exponentially in k.

### Core Assumptions

1. **Common Knowledge of Rationality** — agents are risk-neutral Bayesian reasoners
2. **Common Prior** — shared prior distribution over outcomes and signals
3. **Stochastic Relevance** — each distinct signal induces a unique posterior
4. **Conditional Independence** — agents' signals are independent given the outcome
5. **(δ,η)-Informativeness** — uniform bounds on signal quality

## How Yiling Implements the Theory

| Paper Concept | Implementation |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Sequential reporting | \`predict()\` function, one per wallet |
| Random termination (α) | \`hash % WAD < alpha\` after each prediction |
| Reference agent = last reporter | Last predictor's value = \`qFinal\` |
| Cross-entropy scoring | \`FixedPointMath.crossEntropyScore()\` |
| Flat reward for last k | \`bond + flatReward\` for final k agents |
| Information aggregation | Previous predictions visible on-chain |
| Bond mechanism | \`msg.value\` attached to each prediction |

## Write Functions

### \`createMarket\`

\`\`\`solidity
function createMarket(
    string calldata question,
    uint256 alpha,          // Stop probability (WAD)
    uint256 k,              // Last k agents get flat reward
    uint256 flatReward,     // Flat reward R (wei)
    uint256 bondAmount,     // Bond per prediction (wei)
    uint256 liquidityParam, // LMSR scaling b (wei)
    uint256 initialPrice    // Starting price (WAD)
) external payable returns (uint256 marketId)
\`\`\`

Creates a new prediction market. Must send sufficient ETH to fund the market pool.

### \`predict\`

\`\`\`solidity
function predict(uint256 marketId, uint256 probability) external payable
\`\`\`

Submit a prediction with bond attached. Triggers random stop check after each call. One prediction per wallet per market.

### \`claimPayout\`

\`\`\`solidity
function claimPayout(uint256 marketId) external
\`\`\`

Claim your payout from a resolved market. Payout = bond ± scoring reward/penalty.

### \`forceResolve\`

\`\`\`solidity
function forceResolve(uint256 marketId) external
\`\`\`

Force-resolve a stale market. Owner can call anytime, anyone can call after 2 days of inactivity.

## Read Functions

| Function | Returns | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| \`getMarketCount()\` | uint256 | Total markets created |
| \`getMarketInfo(id)\` | tuple | Core market data (question, price, status) |
| \`getMarketParams(id)\` | tuple | Market configuration (alpha, k, bond, etc.) |
| \`getPrediction(id, idx)\` | tuple | Specific prediction details |
| \`getPayoutAmount(id, addr)\` | uint256 | Net payout amount (post-fee) |
| \`isMarketActive(id)\` | bool | Whether market is accepting predictions |
| \`hasPredicted(id, addr)\` | bool | Whether address has already predicted |

## Events

\`\`\`solidity
event MarketCreated(uint256 indexed marketId, string question, ...)
event PredictionMade(uint256 indexed marketId, address indexed predictor, ...)
event MarketResolved(uint256 indexed marketId, uint256 finalPrice, ...)
event PayoutClaimed(uint256 indexed marketId, address indexed predictor, ...)

  "contracts/fixed-point-math": `# FixedPointMath.sol

On-chain fixed-point math library for cross-entropy scoring.

## Usage

\`\`\`solidity
import {FixedPointMath} from "yiling-protocol/src/libraries/FixedPointMath.sol";
\`\`\`

## Functions

### \`lnWad(uint256 x) → int256\`

Computes ln(x) in WAD format. Reverts if x == 0.

### \`crossEntropyScore(uint256 q, uint256 p) → int256\`

\`S(q, p) = q × ln(p) + (1-q) × ln(1-p)\`

### \`deltaPayout(uint256 qFinal, uint256 pBefore, uint256 pAfter) → int256\`

Delta score for payouts. Positive = moved toward truth. Used internally by PredictionMarket to calculate agent payouts.

## WAD Format

All values use 1e18 fixed-point representation:

\`\`\`
1.0   = 1000000000000000000  (1e18)
0.5   = 500000000000000000   (5e17)
0.01  = 10000000000000000    (1e16)
\`\`\`

## Standalone Usage

You can use FixedPointMath independently in your own contracts:

\`\`\`solidity
int256 result = FixedPointMath.lnWad(500000000000000000); // ln(0.5)
// result = -693147180559945309
\`\`\``,

  "roadmap/coming-soon": `# Coming Soon

Yiling Protocol is live on Base. Here's what's next.

## Multi-Chain Expansion

The protocol is EVM-compatible and can be deployed on any chain with minimal configuration. Planned deployments:

| Chain | Status | Timeline |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **Base** | ✅ Live | — |
| Ethereum | Planned | Q2 2026 |
| Arbitrum | Planned | Q2 2026 |
| Optimism | Planned | Q2 2026 |
| Monad | Planned | Q3 2026 |
| Polygon | Planned | Q3 2026 |
| Other EVM | Under consideration | TBD |

> Non-EVM chains (Solana, Sui, Aptos) require contract porting. The core SKC math is fully portable.

## SDK & Developer Tools

| Tool | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Python SDK | Client library, agent runner | In development |
| TypeScript SDK | Client library, TypeScript types | In development |
| CLI | Command-line market interaction | In development |
| REST API | HTTP endpoints for market data | Planned |
| WebSocket | Real-time market event streaming | Planned |
| Agent Framework | Multi-strategy AI agent toolkit | In development |

## Agent Strategies

Built-in AI agent personas under development:

| Strategy | Approach |
|----------|----------|
| Analyst | Data-driven, reference class forecasting |
| Bayesian | Explicit prior → likelihood → posterior |
| Economist | Macro forces, incentives, structural trends |
| Contrarian | Challenges consensus, detects groupthink |
| Ensemble | Multi-model aggregation (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini) |

## Protocol Features

- **Multi-outcome markets** — Beyond binary yes/no to categorical outcomes
- **Continuous markets** — Real-valued predictions (prices, dates, quantities)
- **Market templates** — Pre-configured market types for common use cases
- **Governance module** — Use Yiling for DAO decision-making
- **Dispute resolution** — Integrate as an arbitration layer

## Open Source

The protocol is fully open source. Contributions welcome.
